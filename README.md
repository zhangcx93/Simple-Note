# Simple Note

A simple note app built with MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS.  
It looks somehow like a Google Keep, for I just want it to be designed simple.  
Use this project as a guide to MEAN.

## Getting Started
Install the requirement with: `npm install`

Install and run the `MongoDB`

Run it with `node app.js` or test it with `nodemon app.js` which restart node on code update

Build the sass with `grunt`, watch it with `grunt watch`

## Contributing

Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
